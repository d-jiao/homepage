- 2022.04.14 updates on the (incoming) doctoral studies and the color map
- 2022.03.14 reorganization of the site and addition on all the major parts of the site
- 2022.02.20 initial commit to set up the homepage

## Acknowledgements
- The [Jekyll Run](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dedsec727.jekyll-run) plugin has greatly facilitated my development of this site in a local environment with [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).
- To [Build a Jekyll development environment with VS Code & Remote Containers](https://powers-hell.com/2021/07/25/build-a-jekyll-development-environment-with-vs-code-remote-containers/) is also fun.
- I developed this personal website based on the great work, [Academic Portfolio](https://ys1998.github.io/academic-portfolio), by [Yash Shah](https://github.com/ys1998), which has been a child project of Steve Miller's [no-good-very-bad](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template) template.
