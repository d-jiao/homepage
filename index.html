        Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>
        
        My name is Dian Jiao and I am a first-year PhD student in Accounting at Columbia Business School. I am primarily interested in learning about how the accounting information can shape the market efficiency and the role of disclosure and information intermediaries in the process. <br><br>

        Prior to joining CBS, I had served for two years as a quantitative researcher at Ruitian Capital, where I worked on systematic quantimental equity stratgies based on statistical methods. I received M.S. in Financial Engineering from Columbia, M.Fin. from SAIF, and B.S. in Applied Math from SJTU. <br><br>

        <!-- I maintain a list of my publications, research projects, and implementations under the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/research/">Research</a> tab. To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/cv/">curriculum vitae</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/about">about me</a> and me on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/media/">media</a>. <br><br> -->

        Born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henan">Henan Province</a>, the birthplace of Chinese Civilization with over 3,200 years of recorded history, I enjoy history, Chinese poems, and Chinese calligraphy. Also, I am interested in basketball, table tennis, and road cycling.
