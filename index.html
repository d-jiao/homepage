        Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>
        
        My name is Dian Jiao and I am a dedicated researcher in accounting. I am applying for the Accounting PhD programs for fall 2022 entrance. <br><br>

        I maintain a list of my publications, research projects and implementations under the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="https://github.com/d-jiao">Github profile.</a><br><br>

        To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I blog (although quite less frequently) and pin them down <a href="/blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.
